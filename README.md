## About Me
I'm a data science and machine learning enthusiast with a strong technical foundation built from my experience as a **DevOps and Application Systems Administrator**. 

In my current role, I deploy code, manage Azure DevOps pipelines and permissions, configure server environments, and support enterprise applications. Just a few of many skills that have sharpened my problem-solving and techincal thinking abilities.

I earned my **B.S. in Computer Science** with an initial focus on software engineering, but towards the end of my studies I discovered a deep passion for using data to drive insights and build predictive models.  
Today, I'm actively growing my portfolio of ML projects, honing skills in **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **scikit-learn**, and continuously expanding into new tools and techniques.

I'm excited to combine my hands-on IT experience with a strong analytical mindset to deliver data-driven solutions in real-world environments.
